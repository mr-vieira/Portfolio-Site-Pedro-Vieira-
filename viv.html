          <p>
            Whether caused by the "always on" lifestyle, information overload, stress at work or life in general, people are struggling more and more to manage and deal with daily health issues. Viv was created to help these users stay on top of
            their health and wellness.
          </p>

        </div>

          <h2>The Approach</h2>

          <p>
            Design Thinking was the selected framework to guide the project. The three main phases are Inspiration, Conceptualization and Iteration.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <div class="row">

          <h3>Defining the Problem</h3>

          <p>
            We can’t find solutions for problems that we don’t understand. Before even starting to think of solutions, I created the problem statement. Not only did it helped to keep focus on the problem but also on the potential users.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem statement was later modifyed based on user research.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>

          <p>
            Health-conscious users need a way to easily record and update health and medical data, as well as get access to health improvement guidance, because they want to stay in control of their health and wellness condition as much as possible.
            <br>We will know this to be true when we see a recurring number of visits per user, as well as an increasing volume of uploaded information.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="row">

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            At this point, there was little understanding of which kind of solutions already existed in the market to address the problem. I conducted a competitive analysis in order to understand who our competitors were, learn how they’ve managed
            to solve similar problems, and what opportunities/gaps existed.
          </p>

          </picture>

          <h4>Opportunities</h4>
          <p>
            The possibility of combining multiple practical features in one app alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple, minimal app that can be used in the most stressful of contexts.
          </p>

        </div>


        <div class="row">

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            After gaining a better perspective of the problem space, it was time to engage with potential users and identify their actual needs and goals. To that effect, a user research was conducted by means of interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            User interviews seemed to be a great first approach, as they’re quite inexpensive and allow to collect relevant qualitative data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the actual user interviews, it was necessary to set up the research goals.
          </p>

          <h4>Research Goals</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>To understand users on a deeper level regarding their health: what their habits are, what routines, goals, obstacles.</li>
            <li>Get to know users’ opinions on existing Apps and competing platforms.</li>
            <li>Collect data that may validate previous assumptions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Key Findings</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Health seems to be a subject that drives a lot of the respondents’ decisions during the day.</li>
            <li>These kind of apps are somehow useful but the fact that you need one application for each kind of issue makes it all that more confusing.</li>
            <li>All of the participants struggle when trying to find a document, an exam result, or that last prescription. Lack of organization seems to be the cause of some stress.</li>
            <li>Most of participants have tried a few self-care apps to assist them with their meditation, help them sleep better, or simply track some biometric data.</li>
            <li>When it comes to scheduling appointments, they usually do it by phone and save the date on their digital calendars.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>


        <div class="row">
          <h3>Research Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            After a reasonable amount of data was collected from the previous stages, it was time to explore, make some sense of it, and turn it into meaningful insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            This step consisted of pulling out behaviours, needs, goals, frustrations, quotes and facts from the interviews’ data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next move was to sort information and build clusters of related notes/ideas by creating an Affinity Map.
          </p>

          <h4>Insights</h4>

          <h3>Rethinking the Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Based on new insights gathered from user research, I decided to reformulate the problem.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem Statement Revised</h4>
          <p>
            Health-conscious users need a way to properly assess their own health condition, save medical and health information and share it with others. because they want to stay in control of their health and wellness condition as much as
            possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will know this to be true when we see an increasing volume of performed assessments and uploaded information.

          <h3>User Personas & Journey Maps</h3>
          <p>
            New findings from users interviews allowed for the creation of user personas with very real needs, behaviours, pain points and goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the Personas’ Frustrations, Motivations, Needs & Goals were identifyed, I could start working on journey maps and visualize the processes that users might go through to achieve their individual goals.

          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the sitemap and user flows, I then started to sketch the first paper wireframes that were then grouped together making low-fidelity prototypes of what I considered to be the 3 core features of
            the app:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Self-check Assessment</li>
            <li>Export & Share Self-check Reports</li>

          <h4>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <p>
            Low-fidelity prototypes alowed me to focus and iterate on the basic structure of the navigation, without having to worry about visual details.
          </p>

          <h4>High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <p>
            Next, I’ve created the High-fidelity version prototype, showing a lot more detail regarding layout, buttons, icons and real or placeholder copy.
          </p>

        <div class="row">

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Having a full functioning and interactive prototype for each core feature, these were now ready to be tested.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overall goal of the testing was to assess the learnability level of new users when interacting with the mobile version of the Platform for the first time.
          </p>

          <p>
            After sharing the first high-fidelity prototypes with users in a usability testing round, I was able to collect valuable feedback, identify the main issues and iterate on new versions of the prototype.

          <h4>Issue 1</h4>
          <p>
            When asked to complete a self-check, not all participants recognized “Shelf-check” links as something to assess one’s health/ symptoms
          </p>

          <h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Change copy to something more direct and obvious such as: “Health-check”
          </p>

          </picture>

          <h4>Issue 2</h4>
          <p>
            users should be able to name a file, assign it to a category and finally upload it to the platform. However, this design proved to be innefective when submited to a usability test, as users weren’t able to recognize the “category”
            element
            as a dropdown menu.
          </p>

          <h4>Proposed Solution</h4>
          <p>
            Change the drop-down menu to a more familiar / common pattern.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back, there are a few steps that I would take differently. I foccused on qualitative research methods alone, and although users interviews provided great insight material, it would be good to obtain findings from a larger
            sample of potential users.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would probably try to explore some of the features a little further, like the self-assessment tool. Research with medical staff could bring new perspectives and insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, I believe that through the design process of “Viv”, true insights were uncovered and ther’s still a lot to explore with regards to other user's needs and resulting features.
