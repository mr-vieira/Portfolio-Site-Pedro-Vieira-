        <h3>Putting the prototype to the test.</h3>
        <p>After recruiting 3 new participants, it was time to put the prototype to the test, and evaluate if the proposed features, Information architecture and navigation were clear and efficient.</p>
        <p>To evaluate a participant’s ability to complete specific tasks, I’ve defined 4 Scenario tasks, giving real-world context to usability testing.</p>


        <h3>Scenario Tasks</h3>
        <div class="row" id="enhanced">

          <h4>(Task 1)</h4>
          <p>"You’ve decided to learn a new idiom and had just installed a language learning app on your smartphone. Try to create a new account and get to the dashboard."</p>

        <div class="row" id="enhanced">
          <h4>(Task 2)</h4>
          <p>"Let’s say that one of your weak spots is pronunciation. How would you use this app to help you with that?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="enhanced">
          <h4>(Task 3)</h4>
          <p>"Starting and maintaining new habits, like learning a new idiom, can present a real challenge. Can you use the app to help you establish new habits? How?"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="enhanced">
          <h4>(Task 4)</h4>
          <p>"Occasionally you read or hear words/expressions that you’d like to keep and not forget. Use the app to save new vocabulary and add your definitions."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Summarizing Findings</h3>
        <p>As users interacted with the prototype and completed given tasks, I was able to identify friction points and discover areas of improvement.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>


        <div class="row">

          <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
          <p>As my first experience with a UX design project, the learning by doing approach felt like a good starting point.</p>
          <p>Instead of expecting breakthrough ideas, I was focused instead on internalizing the methods, frameworks and mindset of a UX designer.
          </p>


          <h4>“Scratching my own itch?”</h4>
          <p>To get a better understanding of the problem area, and the solutions that have already been created to address it, I conducted a competitive analysis on some of the most well-known apps in this field, namely: Babbel, Duolingo and BBC
            Learning English. Being around for quite some time, and well-rated in Play Store and App Store, I assumed they must be doing something right.</p>

            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            <p>By approaching this challenge alone, I missed the collaboration aspect of it. From my previous work experience, bouncing ideas with others is one of the best ways of getting new perspectives on a problem and potential ways of solving it.</p>

            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
            <p>I intend to continue iterating by submitting the revised prototype to a few more usability testing rounds.</p>
            <p>Before moving to high-fidelity prototypes, I would also like to test a few more features related to human interaction, and how students can help each other through their learning journey.</p>
